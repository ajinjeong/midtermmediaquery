	<div class="description"> <p>Seventeen is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has conquered a large audience since its debut and has grown into an internationally recognized K-Pop group with signature music and performances. The group debuted on May 26, 2015, with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat. Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members involved in songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music and performances.They perform as one group and are divided into three units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. </p>
